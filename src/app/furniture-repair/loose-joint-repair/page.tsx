          <p>
            A wobbly chair or table is annoying and potentially dangerous. Loose joints get worse over time as the looseness causes more stress on the remaining joints. We repair loose joints properly so they stay tight. Call us at (770) 592-4689 for an assessment.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've been repairing loose furniture joints in Cherokee County for almost 20 years. Proper technique makes all the difference - a correctly repaired joint is often stronger than the original. We don't take shortcuts.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Why Joints Come Loose</h3>

          <p>
            Several factors cause furniture joints to loosen over time. Understanding the cause helps you understand why proper repair technique matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Glue Deterioration</strong> - Original glue dries out and becomes brittle. Traditional hide glue used in older furniture especially degrades with age. Even modern wood glues eventually break down, particularly in humid environments like we have here in Georgia.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Wood Movement</strong> - Wood absorbs and releases moisture from the air. In our humid summers, wood expands. In dry winter heating, it contracts. This constant movement works joints loose over decades. Atlanta-area homes with heating and air conditioning cycles see significant wood movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stress from Use</strong> - Every time you lean back in a chair, scoot it across the floor, or sit down hard, stress goes into the joints. Kids climbing on furniture, pets jumping up, everyday use - it all adds up over years.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Poor Original Construction</strong> - Not all furniture is well-made. Mass-produced furniture often has marginal joint fit from the factory. Cheap glue, rushed assembly, poor joint design - these pieces fail sooner.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Failed Previous Repairs</strong> - We see this constantly. Someone tried to fix a loose joint by just squirting glue in without proper technique. It fails quickly, and now the joint is contaminated with old dried glue that complicates proper repair.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Proper Repair Technique</h3>

          <p>
            The right way to fix a loose joint requires proper technique. Just squirting glue into a gap rarely works long-term because glue doesn't bond well to old dried glue, and there's no clamping pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Complete Disassembly</strong> - The affected joints need to come completely apart. You can't properly repair a joint that's partially attached. We carefully separate pieces without damaging the wood.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Clean All Old Glue</strong> - Dried glue must be removed from both surfaces. We scrape, sand, or chisel off old glue residue to get down to bare wood. New glue bonds to wood, not to old glue.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Assess the Fit</strong> - After cleaning, we check how the joint fits together. Years of wear may have changed the fit. A tenon that was snug in its mortise may now be loose. Gaps need to be addressed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Make Adjustments</strong> - Loose-fitting joints need modification. We might shim a tenon with thin veneer strips, fill a worn mortise, or otherwise adjust the fit for a snug connection.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Apply Quality Glue</strong> - We use professional-grade wood glue appropriate for the repair. Standard PVA for most work, specialized glues for outdoor furniture or pieces that may need future repair.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Proper Clamping</strong> - Glue needs pressure during curing to make a strong bond. We apply appropriate clamps and verify the furniture is square before the glue sets.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Full Curing Time</strong> - Glue needs time to cure fully before the furniture is used. We don't rush this process. Rushed repairs fail.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Types of Joints We Repair</h3>

          <p>
            Furniture uses various joint types, each requiring appropriate repair techniques:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Mortise and Tenon</strong> - A peg (tenon) fits into a hole (mortise). The strongest traditional joint, common in quality chairs and tables. When properly repaired, these joints are extremely durable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dowel Joints</strong> - Round wooden pegs connect pieces. Very common in modern furniture. Dowels can break, become loose, or wear oval over time. We can replace dowels when needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dovetails</strong> - Interlocking wedge-shaped cuts, typically used in drawers and case construction. Rarely fail completely but can loosen over time. Repair usually involves regluing with proper clamping.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Lap Joints</strong> - Overlapping pieces joined together. Used in frame construction. These can be reglued and often reinforced with hidden screws.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Finger Joints</strong> - Interlocking rectangular cuts. Used in some case construction and longer pieces. Repair is similar to dovetails.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Biscuit Joints</strong> - Compressed wood wafers fit into slots. Common in modern manufactured furniture. Can be reglued if the biscuits haven't deteriorated.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">When Reinforcement is Needed</h3>

          <p>
            Sometimes joints have worn to where glue alone won't hold. The joint fit is too loose, wood is damaged, or the original design was inadequate.
          </p>

          <p>
            In these cases we add appropriate reinforcement while maintaining the furniture's appearance:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dowel Pins</strong> - We can drill through joints and add hidden dowel pins for additional strength. The dowels are below the surface and plugged to hide them.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Corner Blocks</strong> - Triangular blocks inside corners add tremendous strength. They're hidden from view but provide rigid support.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Metal Brackets</strong> - Where appropriate, we use L-brackets or mending plates hidden inside the furniture structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Epoxy Fill</strong> - For damaged wood around joints, structural epoxy can rebuild missing material and create a solid base for the joint.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Common Furniture We Repair</h3>

          <p>
            We repair loose joints in all types of wood furniture:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dining and Kitchen Chairs</strong> - The most common loose joint repair. Chairs take constant stress and we repair dozens every month.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tables</strong> - Dining tables, kitchen tables, coffee tables, end tables. Leg joints, apron connections, and pedestal bases all loosen over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Bed Frames</strong> - Headboard joints, side rail connections, and footboard joints all take stress from use.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dressers and Nightstands</strong> - Case construction joints, drawer guides, and trim pieces can loosen.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Desks</strong> - Leg joints, drawer boxes, and panel joints common in desks.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Rocking Chairs</strong> - These take unique stress from the rocking motion. Joints need proper repair to handle the forces.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Antique Furniture</strong> - Older pieces with hide glue joints commonly need repair. We're careful with antiques to preserve value.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Don't Wait</h3>

          <p>
            Loose joints get worse over time. The wobble puts extra stress on remaining joints, causing them to fail too. What starts as one loose joint becomes four. The chair that was just a little wobbly becomes dangerous to sit in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Address loose joints early before the problem spreads. Repair is simpler and less expensive when caught early.
          </p>
