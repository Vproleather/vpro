          <p>
            Water and wood furniture don't mix. Whether from flooding, a burst pipe, a roof leak, or just a spilled drink that sat too long, water damage can ruin furniture. But in many cases, water damaged furniture can be restored. We specialize in water damage repair. Call us at (770) 592-4689 - quick action gets better results.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've been restoring water damaged furniture in Cherokee County for almost 20 years. Georgia's heavy rain storms, humid summers, and occasional flooding mean we see a lot of water damage. Many pieces that look ruined can actually be saved.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Types of Water Damage</h3>

          <p>
            Water affects furniture in different ways depending on the amount of water, how long it was wet, and the type of furniture:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>White Rings and Stains</strong> - That white ring from a sweating glass? That's moisture trapped under the finish. It hasn't penetrated the wood yet. These are usually the easiest water stains to treat - often they can be completely eliminated.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dark Stains</strong> - Dark stains mean water has penetrated through the finish into the wood itself. The wood fibers have absorbed water and discolored. These are more challenging but often treatable with bleaching and refinishing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Warping, Cupping, or Bowing</strong> - When wood absorbs water unevenly, it swells unevenly. A tabletop wet on one side and dry on the other will cup or bow. Solid wood panels can warp dramatically.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Swelling at Joints and Drawers</strong> - Wet wood swells. Drawers that won't open, doors that won't close, joints that have pushed apart - all common water damage symptoms. As the wood dries, it may shrink back, but often unevenly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Veneer Problems</strong> - Water gets under veneer and breaks the glue bond. Veneer bubbles, lifts, and separates. Old hide glue is especially vulnerable to water.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Mold and Mildew</strong> - Furniture that stayed wet for days can develop mold. You may see visible mold or just smell a musty odor. Mold needs treatment for health reasons and to prevent further damage.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Flood Damage Restoration</h3>

          <p>
            Flooding is common in our area during heavy rains. Cherokee County sees flash flooding, creek overflow, and basement flooding. If your furniture has been submerged or soaked in a flood, quick action helps:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Get It Out of the Water</strong> - Remove furniture from standing water as soon as safely possible. The longer it sits in water, the more damage occurs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Start Drying</strong> - Move furniture to a dry area with good air circulation. Use fans to keep air moving. Don't use direct heat like hair dryers - that causes uneven drying and more warping.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Don't Force Anything</strong> - Swollen drawers and doors may be stuck. Don't force them open - you'll break something. Let the wood dry first.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Call Us</strong> - We can assess what can be saved and start proper restoration. The sooner we start, the better the outcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            Flood water is especially damaging because it's usually dirty - carrying mud, sewage, or other contaminants that add to the damage and create health concerns.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Warping Repair</h3>

          <p>
            Warped wood can sometimes be straightened using controlled moisture and pressure over time. We use techniques that gradually reshape the wood without cracking or breaking it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Success depends on several factors: the severity of warping, the type of wood (some species are more cooperative than others), and how the piece is constructed (solid wood vs. veneered, how it's joined).
          </p>

          <p>
            We assess each case honestly. Minor warping often responds well to treatment. Severe warping may not be fully correctable. Sometimes a piece can be improved but not made perfect. We'll tell you what to expect before starting work.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Stain Removal</h3>

          <p>
            Water stains in the finish (white rings and clouding) can often be removed with techniques that don't damage the underlying finish. Heat treatment, mild abrasives, and refinishing solvents can eliminate many surface water stains.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deep stains in the wood itself require more aggressive treatment. Oxalic acid bleaching can lighten dark water stains in the wood. After bleaching, the area needs refinishing to match the surrounding wood.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not all stains can be completely eliminated, but most can be significantly improved. We evaluate what approach is needed for your specific situation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Mold Treatment</h3>

          <p>
            Furniture that stayed wet can develop mold. This is a health concern - mold spores affect air quality and can cause respiratory issues. Mold also continues to damage the furniture if not treated.
          </p>

          <p>
            We treat mold-affected furniture with appropriate fungicides that kill mold without damaging the furniture. We clean visible mold growth and treat surfaces to prevent regrowth. Severely mold-damaged pieces may need refinishing to seal in any remaining spores.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you see mold on furniture, avoid disturbing it until it can be properly treated - disturbing mold releases spores into the air.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Veneer Repair</h3>

          <p>
            Water-damaged veneer needs careful attention. We reglue lifted veneer, clamp it flat, and touch up any finish damage. Missing or destroyed veneer sections can be patched with matching material.
          </p>

          <p>
            On antique pieces with original veneer, we try to preserve as much original material as possible while making necessary repairs.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Insurance Work</h3>

          <p>
            Water damage from flooding, burst pipes, or roof leaks is often covered by homeowners insurance. We work with insurance companies regularly and understand the claims process.
          </p>

          <p>
            We provide detailed documentation, photographs, and itemized estimates for your claim. We can work directly with adjusters to explain the damage and proposed repairs. Our goal is to help you get your furniture restored with minimal hassle.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Act Quickly</h3>

          <p>
            With water damage, time matters. The sooner we can start drying and treating the furniture, the better the outcome. Mold starts growing within 24-48 hours in wet conditions. Warping and staining get worse the longer wood stays wet.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have water damaged furniture, call us at (770) 592-4689 right away. We're located at 298 N Briar Ridge in Woodstock and serve all of Cherokee County and North Atlanta.
