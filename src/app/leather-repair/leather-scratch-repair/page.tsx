          </p>

          <p>
            We've been repairing leather scratches in Cherokee County for almost 20 years. Pet scratches, car seat wear, furniture damage - we've seen and fixed it all. Most scratches that look terrible can be completely repaired at a fraction of replacement cost.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Pet Scratch Repair</h3>

          <p>
            Pets love leather furniture just as much as we do. But cats especially like to use it as a scratching post. Those sharp claws leave thin parallel lines that seem to multiply overnight. Dogs scratch leather when they jump up or get excited, and their nails can leave deep gouges.
          </p>

          <p>
            We see pet scratches on sofas, chairs, car seats, and ottomans constantly. Here in Cherokee County, a lot of families have both nice leather furniture and pets. The two don't always coexist peacefully.
          </p>

          <p>
            The good news is most pet scratches can be completely repaired. Light scratches that just affect the surface finish are easy - we can usually make them disappear in an hour or two. Deeper scratches that go into the leather itself take more work but are still fixable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cat scratches</strong> are typically surface-level but numerous. Cats tend to scratch in patterns, leaving groups of parallel lines. We repair these by filling and refinishing the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dog scratches</strong> are often deeper and more random. Dogs might scratch when jumping on furniture or digging at cushions. We repair these with filler and multiple layers of finish.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Car Interior Scratch Repair</h3>

          <p>
            Car leather gets scratched from things you might not even think about. Keys in your back pocket, belt buckles, rivets on jeans, watches, rings - all of these create wear patterns over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Driver's seat bolster wear</strong> is the most common. Every time you get in and out, you slide across the side bolster. After a few years and thousands of entries/exits, the leather wears through. We see this on BMWs, Mercedes, Lexus - any vehicle with leather seats.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Back pocket damage</strong> from wallets, phones, and keys is another common issue. Anything with hard edges in your back pocket can scratch leather over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Child seat damage</strong> - Installing and removing child car seats can scratch and scuff leather. The plastic bases dig into the seat surface.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Other Types of Scratches</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Key and Belt Buckle Scratches</strong> - Common on car seats and furniture both. Keys in a back pocket, belt buckle rubbing - over time these create scratches and scuffs that accumulate into noticeable damage.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Furniture Moving Scratches</strong> - Dragging furniture or bumping into things can scratch leather. We see this a lot after people move. Box corners, furniture dollies, and doorframes all leave their marks.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Everyday Wear</strong> - Rings and watches can scratch leather over time. So can zippers, buttons, and rivets on clothing. Handbag hardware. Toy edges. The list is endless.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Accidental Damage</strong> - Sometimes scratches happen from accidents. Something falls on the furniture, a child drags a toy across it, the corner of a book gouges the surface. These are usually deeper and need more extensive repair.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Understanding Scratch Depth</h3>

          <p>
            Not all scratches are the same, and depth determines how we repair them:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Surface scratches</strong> only affect the top finish layer. These are the easiest to repair - often just cleaning and a touch-up of color is enough. If you run your finger over it and can't feel the scratch, it's probably surface-level.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Medium scratches</strong> go through the finish into the leather itself but don't cut deeply. These need filler to level the surface before refinishing. They take more time but repair well.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Deep scratches</strong> cut significantly into the leather. These require sub-patches or heavy filler applications, then careful texturing to match the surrounding grain pattern. More work, but still very repairable.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">How We Repair Scratches</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Assessment</strong> - First we evaluate the scratches to determine their depth and extent. We also check the leather type since different leathers need different approaches. We give you an honest assessment of what we can do.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cleaning</strong> - The area needs to be thoroughly clean before any repair. Dirt and oils interfere with the bonding of repair materials.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Filling</strong> - For anything deeper than surface scratches, we apply leather filler to level the damaged area. Multiple thin layers build up better than one thick application.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Sanding and Texturing</strong> - Once the filler cures, we sand it smooth and add texture to match the surrounding leather grain. This step is crucial for invisible repairs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Color Matching</strong> - We use a spectrophotometer to analyze your leather's exact color. Then we mix a custom dye that matches perfectly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Finishing</strong> - Color is applied in thin layers, building up to match the surrounding leather. A topcoat seals everything and provides protection.
          </p>

          <p>
            When done properly, you shouldn't be able to find the repair unless we point it out. The color matches, the texture matches, and the feel is natural.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-10 mb-4">Preventing Future Scratches</h3>

          <p>
            We can apply protective treatments that make leather more resistant to scratching. This is especially helpful if you have pets. The treatment creates a tougher surface that withstands claws better than untreated leather.
          </p>

          <p>
            For car interiors, we recommend keeping keys out of back pockets when sitting. Some people use seat covers on their daily driver and save the bare leather for special occasions.
          </p>

          <p>
            For furniture with pets, consider training and providing alternatives (scratching posts for cats). We can also recommend specific protectants and care routines that help leather resist damage.
          </p>
