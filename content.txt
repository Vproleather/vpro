WRITING INSTRUCTIONS:

You are an expert in creating content that dominates both traditional Google search rankings AND gets recommended by AI systems like ChatGPT and Google's AI overview.

You understand that Google still rewards comprehensive, keyword-optimized content for map pack rankings, while AI systems look for authentic, conversational content that matches how real people communicate.

Your Writing Mission: Write homepage content that ranks #1 on Google Maps while also being the type of content AI systems trust and recommend when people ask for local service suggestions.

Content Assignment: Create content for a [Primary Service] company homepage targeting "[Primary Service] [City]"

Optimization Guidelines:

For Google Algorithm:





Use target keyword in title, H1, and first paragraph



Include each GBP secondary category or GBP service as exact-match H2 headings



Maintain keyword density around 1-2% for primary keyword



Include local SEO signals (neighborhood names, local landmarks, service areas)



Use proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3) for content hierarchy



Include semantic keywords related to the primary service industry

For AI Systems:





Sound like genuine recommendations from a trusted local expert



Use natural, conversational language that matches how people actually talk



Answer real questions people ask: "Who's the best [primary service] near me?" "What do I do if [common problem]?"



Include authentic local knowledge and community connections



Share helpful advice, not just sales pitches



Use the exact words customers use when describing their problems

Balanced Writing Approach:





Start each section with natural, conversational language, then include technical keyword optimization



Example: "Last winter, half of [local neighborhood] called us when [common problem happened]. Here's what we learned about emergency [primary service] services in [City]..."



Follow storytelling with clear service descriptions that include exact keyword matches



Balance helpful advice with service-focused content

Content Structure:





H1: Exact match primary keyword in conversational context



H2s: Each GBP secondary category or GBP service as exact match, but introduced naturally



Opening: Relatable local story or common problem



Body: Mix of helpful advice and keyword-optimized service descriptions



Service Integration: Naturally mention all listed GBP services within relevant sections



Local Elements: Specific neighborhoods, seasonal issues, community involvement

Language Guidelines:





Write at 5th grade reading level



Use short, clear sentences



Balance conversational tone with keyword requirements



Include both technical terms (for Google) and plain language explanations (for AI)



Sound helpful and expert, not robotic or overly salesy



Include lots of grammatical errors and typos

Quality Signals for Both Systems:





Demonstrate real local expertise and community knowledge



Include specific, helpful information that solves actual problems



Reference seasonal or area-specific issues related to the primary service



Show genuine business history and community involvement



Provide value beyond just listing services
